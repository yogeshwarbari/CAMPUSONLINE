# Campus Online

 This is my try to make a discord like application for students, where they can make groups based on certain topics and share their thoughts about that topic.
 
 
Pre-requisites:
  - Python3
  - Django 4.x.x

User can 
  - sign up
  - login
  - create room
  - delete rooms created by the user
  - comment in the rooms
  - delete own comments 
  - can see comments made by other users
  
User cannot
  - delete rooms created by other users
  - delete other users' comments
  
Future scope for improvement :
  - Web socket implementation for real time update of newly created rooms and comments.
  - UI improvement.
  - Make topic field as textbox instead of dropdown in create room form.
